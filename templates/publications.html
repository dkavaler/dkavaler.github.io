        <strong>Abstract</strong>
        <p>
          <p>
            Learning to work with others is part and parcel of software development,
            especially in Open Source Software projects. The social and technical activities
            of all developers in those projects change and evolve together, organized in
            a network of socio-technical links. And as they do, traces are typically visible
            to all, in project repos and through communication between them. Just like open
            source code makes cloning a viable learning and coding mechanism, here we ask if
            the openly observable socio-technical behavior of developers in these projects affects
            others, and is perhaps imitated by them? We are interested in three behaviors in particular,
            which might be visible to all in a socio-technical network of developers: productivity,
            social linking, and file ownership.

            Since OSS projects change dramatically in both social and technical activity over time, static
            approaches, that either ignore time or simplify it to few slices, are frequently inadequate to
            study these networks. On the other hand, ad-hoc dynamic approaches are often only loosely
            supported by theory and can yield misleading findings.

            Borrowing from social network analysis, here we adapt for our purposes the stochastic
            actor-oriented models for studying the evolution of network properties. This modeling
            technique provides methods to study the interplay between behavior influence and network
            architecture as they change over time, in a statistically sound way. When we apply these
            modeling formalism to data from three Apache Software Foundation projects, we find evidence
            of preferential social linking in all projects. On the other hand, we find no evidence for
            the spread of either ownership or productivity behaviors through the networks. This work
            illustrates the potential of dynamical network models for studying influences affecting
            the software process.

        <strong>Abstract</strong>
        <p>
          Programming is knowledge intensive. While it is well understood that
          programmers spend lots of time looking for information, with few exceptions,
          there is a significant lack of data on what information they seek, and why. Modern
          platforms, like Android, comprise complex APIs that often perplex programmers.
          We ask: which elements are confusing, and why? Increasingly, when programmers need answers,
          they turn to StackOverflow. This provides a novel opportunity. There are a vast number
          of applications for Android devices, which can be
          readily analyzed, and many traces of interactions on StackOverflow. These provide a complementary perspective on
          using and asking, and allow the two phenomena to be studied together. How does the market demand for the USE of an
          API drive the market for knowledge about it? Here, we analyze data from Android
          applications and StackOverflow together, to find out what it is that programmers
          want to know and why.
